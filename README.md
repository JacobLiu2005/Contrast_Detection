# Contrast_Detection
Contrast Detection Task for Optogenetics Research
This repository contains the Python-based code for a contrast detection training task used in optogenetics research, developed in the Adesnik Lab at UC Berkeley. The task evaluates the attention span of mice through behavioral experiments involving dynamic stimulus presentation and optogenetic stimulation.

Features
PsychoPy-based task implementation with randomized stimulus positioning and adjustable gains.
Integration of NI-DAQ libraries for seamless hardware control and data acquisition.
Data visualization and analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib for experimental insights.
Automated processing pipelines for neural activity analysis in response to optogenetic stimulation.
Research Context
This code is part of ongoing research to understand the neural mechanisms underlying attention and perception in mice, leveraging optogenetic techniques and behavioral paradigms.

Usage
Designed for researchers in neuroscience and optogenetics, this repository provides a reproducible pipeline for contrast detection tasks.
